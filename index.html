				In the spring of 1986 the TRAA was formed 
				by anglers concerned with the state of the 
				fishery in the Thames River watershed, 
				particularly the dwindling smallmouth bass 
				population in the North Thames River.</p>

				<p>The TRAA is not a fishing club, although 
				most members are anglers and share fishing
				as a common interest. We are a "hands on" 
				environmental group who likes to work at a 
				grass roots level.</p>

				<p>The TRAA is a volunteer organization, 
				governed by a formal constitution and by-
				laws. An elected Executive, with the 
				guidence of the General Membership, sets 
				the policies and direction for the TRAA.</p>

				<p>The TRAA has a history of always having 
				a core group of active members supported 
				by those who just want to be part of the 
				solution. Either way, every member of the TRAA is active in their advocacy for the health of the Thames River watershed and 
				its inhbitants.</p>

				<p>Rainbow trout
					The rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) 
					is a trout and species of salmonid native 
					to cold-water tributaries of the Pacific 
					Ocean in Asia and North America. The 
					steelhead (sometimes called "steelhead trout") is an anadromous (sea-run) form of
					 the coastal rainbow trout (O. m. irideus) 
					or Columbia River redband trout (O. m. 
					gairdneri) that usually returns to fresh 
					water to spawn after living two to three 
					years in the ocean. Freshwater forms that 
					have been introduced into the Great Lakes 
					and migrate into tributaries to spawn are 
					also called steelhead.</p>

					<p>Adult freshwater stream rainbow trout 
					average between 1 and 5 lb (0.5 and 2.3 
					kg), while lake-dwelling and anadromous 
					forms may reach 20 lb (9 kg). Coloration 
					varies widely based on subspecies, forms 
					and habitat. Adult fish are distinguished by
					 a broad reddish stripe along the lateral
					line, from gills to the tail, which is most 
					vivid in breeding males.</p>

					<p>The scientific name of the rainbow trout is
					 Oncorhynchus mykiss. The species was 
					originally named by German naturalist and 
					taxonomist Johann Julius Walbaum in 1792 
					based on type specimens from the 
					Kamchatka Peninsula in Siberia. Walbaum's
					 original species name, mykiss, was
					 derived from the local Kamchatkan 
					name used for the fish, mykizha. 
					The name of the genus is from the 
					Greek onkos ("hook") and rynchos ("nose"),
					 in reference to the hooked jaws of males 
					in the mating season (the "kype").</p>
